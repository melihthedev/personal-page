            <h3>Development & Programming</h3>
            <p>Since I was a little child, I was always interested in computers and I still am. I used to play a lot of video games and I thought it was cool.
                So now, I believe my passion to computers evolved into programming and here I am !
            </p>
            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>I am a native speaker in Turkish and C1 level of English speaker. Also, I can speak a little bit of German. Hallo mein Freund!</p>

                <h3>Aside from being a computer geek in terms of programming, I am also a gamer!</h3>
                <p>The first time I met computers goes back to my childhood. My father was playing video games and I only watched him at that time, because I was afraid to play video games.
                    After playing games for years, I thought this has to be stop and I should do more serious stuff with computers. This is the idea behind the programming love of mine.

                <h3>Sports Should Done by Everyone!</h3>
                <p>Actually I like all kind of sports. But air sports is my favourite If you ask me. Especially us programmers should do exercised regularly If they don't want a back pain everyday. </p>

                <h3>A room without books is like a body without a soul.</h3>
                <p>Reading books clears and calms my soul. There are times in our lives when we feel overwhelmed and stress. At those times, books are my biggest treatment.</p>

            <p>Wouldn't it be awesome if I just code in my car in a rainy day! Being calm as a lemon and having two things that you love together which are car and programming.</p>
            <p>I guess that's just a fantasy. </p>
